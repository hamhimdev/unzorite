## Why?
ZorinOS is in a nutshell, Ubuntu wrapped in their Gnome skin and some pre-installed apps.<br>
Their "Pro" version is a scam, selling ZorinOS Pro for **$36** and includes the following:
1. A customizable GUI based on Gnome that can switch between popular system layouts in the names of macOS, Windows, Ubuntu, ChromeOS etc...
2. Zorin Connect, allows the connection of your mobile device to your ZorinOS machine.
3. Professional-grade creative suite of apps, in the names of GIMP, Krita, KdenLive, Blender etc...
4. Additional artwork for wallpapers.
5. Includes wine (Wine is not an emulator) built-in for Windows Application support<br>

That's it. Nothing more. All for **$36...**
### The Issue
All the things above are either free through other sources or available in forms of other applications that are same or more powerful in terms of features to Zorin's alternative.<br>
Also the fact that ZorinOS is rather outdated and not as reliable as it claims anymore. It's not the only operating system based on the Linux kernel that can run on 15 year old computers, look at arch.
### Back to the question... Why?
This project is to spread awareness about this. We aren't attacking the makers of Zorin, we are just making aware that ZorinOS Pro isn't a good deal.<br>
Along with that this project aims to replicate ZorinOS Pro to the highest level we can achieve. For free of course.<br>
